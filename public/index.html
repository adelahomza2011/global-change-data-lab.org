      <p>The Global Change Data Lab is a charity in the education sector,
        registered in England and Wales (Charity Number 1186433). Our purpose is
        to <strong>advance education in how global living conditions and the
          earth’s environment are changing</strong>, through the production and
        maintenance of public online resources and related products.</p>
      <p>We are focused on solving five big problems.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Daily news is not enough to know about the world</strong>:
          we publish data and research to bring attention to large, yet slow
          transformative processes (e.g. historical reductions in child mortality)
          that are rarely covered by the media.</li>
        <li><strong>To understand how our world is changing we need
            statistics</strong>: Our mission is to make data about the world
          available and understandable to give everyone the research to develop a
          worldview that goes beyond anecdotes and single events.</li>
        <li><strong>Academic research is disconnected from public
            discourse</strong>: Research is often hidden behind paywalls, buried in
          spreadsheets, and written for a specialist audience only. We explain and
          disseminate important findings that would otherwise be inaccessible to a
          general audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Lacking awareness of progress makes us cynical</strong>: we
          show that in many ways living conditions around the world are getting
          better; communicating this enables people to pursue more of what works
          and to be motivated to engage with the challenges that we face.</li>
        <li><strong>Professors and teachers need understandable, free, and
            up-to-date teaching material on global development</strong>: The price
          of textbooks is often prohibitively high and especially in developing
          countries educators lack relevant material. We prepare our work to be
          used as teaching material by everyone without restriction.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <h3>Our World in Data</h3>
      <p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a> is a
        website that shows how <strong>global living conditions and the earth’s
          environment are changing</strong>. The publication is a collaborative
        effort between the researchers of the
        <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/global-development">Oxford
          Martin Programme on Global Development</a> at the <em>University of
          Oxford</em>, who are the scientific editors of the website content; and
        the non-profit organization <em>Global Change Data Lab</em>, who
        publishes and maintains the website.
      </p>

      <h3>Sustainable Development Goals Tracker</h3>
      <p><a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/">SDG Tracker</a> presents data across all available indicators from the Our
        World in Data database, using
        official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. It is the first publication that tracks
        global progress towards the SDGs.</p>

      <h3>Global Change Teaching Hub</h3>
      <p>On the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/teaching">Global Change
          Teaching Hub</a> professors and students find notes, presentation slides,
        and charts for teaching and learning about global development.</p>

      <h3>Other projects</h3>
      <p>We have a number of smaller projects such as <a href="https://africaindata.org/">Africa in Data</a>, a tool to
        standardize
        country names in international statistics, and regularly partner with
        media organizations to provide data and research on global change.</p>
