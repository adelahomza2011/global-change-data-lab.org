        <p>The Global Change Data Lab is a charity in the education sector, registered in England and Wales (Charity
          Number 1186433). Our purpose is to <strong>advance education in how global living conditions and the earth’s
            environment are changing</strong>, through the production and maintenance of public online resources and
          related
          products.</p>
        <p>We are focused on solving five big problems.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Daily news is not enough to know about the world</strong>: we publish data and research to bring
            attention
            to large, yet slow transformative processes (e.g. historical reductions in child mortality) that are rarely
            covered by the media.</li>
          <li><strong>To understand how our world is changing we need statistics</strong>: Our mission is to make data
            about the
            world available and understandable to give everyone the research to develop a worldview that goes beyond
            anecdotes and single events.</li>
          <li><strong>Academic research is disconnected from public discourse</strong>: Research is often hidden behind
            paywalls, buried in spreadsheets, and written for a specialist audience only. We explain and disseminate
            important findings that would otherwise be inaccessible to a general audience.</li>
          <li><strong>Lacking awareness of progress makes us cynical</strong>: we show that in many ways living
            conditions
            around the world are getting better; communicating this enables people to pursue more of what works and to
            be motivated to engage with the challenges that we face.</li>
          <li><strong>Professors and teachers need understandable, free, and up-to-date teaching material on global
              development</strong>: The price of textbooks is often prohibitively high and especially in developing
            countries educators lack relevant material. We prepare our work to be used as teaching material by everyone
            without restriction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Our World in Data</h3>
        <p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our World in Data</a> is a website that shows how <strong>global living
            conditions and the earth’s environment are changing</strong>. The
          publication is a collaborative effort between the researchers of the
          <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/global-development">Oxford
            Martin Programme on Global Development</a> at the <em>University of
            Oxford</em>, who are the scientific editors of the website content; and
          the non-profit organization <em>Global Change Data Lab</em>, who
          publishes and maintains the website.
        </p>

        <h3>Sustainable Development Goals Tracker</h3>
        <p><a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/">SDG Tracker</a> presents data across all available indicators from the Our
          World in Data database, using
          official statistics from the UN and other international organizations. It is the first publication that tracks
          global progress towards the SDGs.</p>

        <h3>Global Change Teaching Hub</h3>
        <p>On the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/teaching">Global Change Teaching Hub</a> professors and students
          find notes, presentation slides, and charts for
          teaching and learning about global development.</p>

        <h3>Other projects</h3>
        <p>We have a number of smaller projects such as <a href="https://africaindata.org/">Africa in Data</a>, a tool
          to standardize country names in international statistics, and regularly partner with media organizations to
          provide data and research on global change.</p>
